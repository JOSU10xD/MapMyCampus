# Project Summary

## Overview
**Campus Map** is an interactive mobile application built with Flutter that helps users navigate a university campus. It provides a visual map where users can find the shortest path between two locations (like classrooms and labs) and even virtually explore the campus using an on-screen joystick.

## Elevator Pitch
"Google Maps for your campus"—a smart, offline-capable navigation tool that guides students and visitors to their destination with precision.

## Key Value Points
*   **Smart Navigation:** Automatically calculates the shortest walking path between any two points on campus.
*   **Interactive Exploration:** Users can virtually walk around the map using a joystick to learn the layout.
*   **Offline Ready:** All map data and navigation logic are stored locally, so it works without an internet connection.

## Missing Information
*   **Map Assets:** The project relies on specific SVG files (`assets/A_Block_Ground.svg`) which are assumed to be present but were not inspected for visual content.
*   **Detailed Floor Plans:** Currently, the data seems focused on "Ground Floor" (based on file names), but the data model supports multiple floors.
